# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of "objects," which can contain data and code. It emphasizes the organization of code into a collection of manageable, reusable components. OOP facilitates the creation of modular programs and enables the building of software systems that are more scalable and easier to maintain.

## OOP Vs Procedural Programming (POP)

OOP differs from Procedural Programming (POP) in several key aspects:

- OOP focuses on the creation of objects that encapsulate data and behavior, whereas POP emphasizes procedures or routines.
- OOP supports features like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, enabling better code organization and reusability, while POP tends to be more straightforward and linear.
- OOP promotes a more intuitive approach to problem-solving by modeling real-world entities as objects, making it ideal for complex and large-scale applications, while POP is generally better suited for simpler, smaller-scale programs.

## Class

In OOP, a class is a blueprint or template that defines the attributes and behaviors of an object. It serves as a prototype for creating objects that share similar characteristics. A class encapsulates data and methods that are specific to the objects it represents.

## Object

An object is an instance of a class. It represents a particular entity within a program and embodies the attributes and behaviors defined by its class. Objects can interact with each other through methods and can have their own unique states.

## Methods

Methods are functions that are defined within a class and are responsible for performing specific actions or operations on the data associated with the class. They enable objects to exhibit behaviors and perform tasks relevant to their nature.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a fundamental principle of OOP that involves bundling the data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit, i.e., a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components and hides the internal workings of the object from the outside. Encapsulation promotes data protection and helps maintain the integrity of the data.

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a feature of OOP that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, known as the superclass or base class. The class that inherits these properties is referred to as the subclass or derived class. Inheritance promotes code reusability and enables the creation of a hierarchical class structure.
