# Stack Data Structure

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. It is commonly used to manage data in a way that supports two primary operations: push (adding an item to the stack) and pop (removing the top item from the stack).

## Stack as an Abstract Data Type (ADT)

A **stack** can be defined as an **Abstract Data Type (ADT)**, which means it is defined by its behavior and a set of operations, without specifying its internal implementation. The key operations of the stack ADT are **push**, **pop**, **peek**, and **isEmpty**.

## Operations of Stack

A stack supports the following operations:

- **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove the element from the top of the stack.
- **Peek (Top)**: Get the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
- **isEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty.

## Stack Implementation using Array

A stack can be implemented using an array. In this implementation, a fixed-size array is used to hold the stack elements. The top of the stack is represented by an index, and elements are pushed and popped at this index.

## Stack Implementation using Linked List

Another common way to implement a stack is by using a linked list. In this implementation, each element in the stack is a node in the linked list. The top of the stack is the head of the linked list, and elements are pushed and popped by adding or removing nodes at the head.

## Problems in Array-based Implementation

- **Fixed Size**: Array-based implementations have a fixed size, making them prone to overflow if the stack exceeds its capacity.
- **Inefficient Resize**: Dynamic resizing can be complex and inefficient.
- **Wasted Space**: Arrays may waste memory when the stack size is much smaller than the array's capacity.

## Applications of Stack

Stacks find applications in various computer science and software engineering scenarios, including:

- **Expression Evaluation**: Stacks are used to evaluate mathematical expressions, especially infix-to-postfix conversion and postfix expression evaluation.
- **Function Call Management**: Stacks are used in programming languages to manage function calls and local variables.
- **Undo Mechanisms**: Many software applications implement an undo feature using a stack to keep track of actions.
- **Backtracking Algorithms**: Stacks are used in backtracking algorithms to store the state of decisions and backtrack when needed.
- **Browser History**: Web browsers use a stack to manage the history of visited web pages.
